## The problem
Given an array of distinct integers, find length of the longest subarray which contains numbers that can be arranged in a continuous sequence.

### Example

#### input 01
```
arr[] = {10, 12, 11};
```

#### output 01
```
Length of the longest contiguous subarray is 3

```

#### input 02
```
arr[] = {14, 12, 11, 20};
```

#### output 02
```
Length of the longest contiguous subarray is 2

```

#### input 03
```
arr[] = {1, 56, 58, 57, 90, 92, 94, 93, 91, 45};
```

#### output 03
```
Length of the longest contiguous subarray is 5
